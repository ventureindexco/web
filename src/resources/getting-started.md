#### Startup Playbook (2015)

> "We spend a lot of time advising startups. Though one-on-one advice will always be crucial, we thought it might help us scale Y Combinator if we could distill the most generalizable parts of this advice into a sort of playbook we could give YC and YC Fellowship companies.
>
> Then we thought we should just give it to everyone.
>
> This is meant for people new to the world of startups. Most of this will not be new to people who have read a lot of what YC partners have written—the goal is to get it into one place.
>
> There may be a part II on how to scale a startup later—this mostly covers how to start one."
